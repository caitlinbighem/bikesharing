## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to generate a proposal that provides investors with accurate information to support further investment in a bike sharing program located in Des Moines, Iowa. With the current dataset we are able to build visualizations to show a number of trends among a similar program, such as the duration of an average bike ride and the link between gender and popular bike ride times. Specifically, the following set of visualizations: 

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
The results of the analysis and visualizations are shown below:

## Summary
As a result of this analysis, we can conclude that a generous portion of the users most likely are not visiting tourists but every day commuters as the peak times are during the popular hours of the average commutes both to and from work. In addition, the bulk of users are male, while this does not suggest a significant impact, it could be used as an interesting direction for any future marketing and ad campaigns. A noteworthy tidbit we also learned from this analysis is that many of the trip durations peaked within 5 minutes. This result can be used to map the placement of bike sharing stations. While Des Moines and New York City are very different urban settings, this will need to be taken into account as well, so it may be best to place the sharing stations farther apart than in comparison to larger cities.
