## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to generate a proposal that provides investors with accurate information to support further investment in a bike sharing program located in Des Moines, Iowa. With the current dataset we are able to build visualizations to show a number of trends among a similar program, such as the duration of an average bike ride and the link between gender and popular bike ride times. Specifically, the following set of visualizations: 

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
The results of the analysis and visualizations are shown below:
